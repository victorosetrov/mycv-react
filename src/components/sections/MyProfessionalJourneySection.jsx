        <p>
          My career took a significant turn in August 2019 when I joined DV360,
          Google via Accenture, as a Technical Analyst. There, I embraced the
          role of supporting a top-tier web-based online advertising platform
          and a real-time bidding solution renowned globally. My focus was
          troubleshooting complex client issues, where I honed my skills in
          debugging, probability/statistics, and tech data analytics.

          In May 2021, I embarked on a new chapter with Zendesk as a Technical
          Support Engineer. My responsibilities escalated to L2 support, dealing
          with advanced escalated tickets. I tackled troubleshooting client
          issues, delving into debugging, API integration, and working with
          various apps, frameworks, and libraries. Additionally, I played a
          pivotal role in escalating bugs and tasks to DevOps, ensuring
          efficient problem resolution and customer satisfaction.
